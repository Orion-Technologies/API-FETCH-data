# FetchData
Using API to work with data.

## usage
You can enter name of universities or topic related with universities and the page show you the topics.

## Installation
You don't need anymore than a browser, I will recomend you use Chome to have the best experience.

## Description
I used API to connect with this site and display the content in my app, I did pagination of the content and I used Bootstrap for the styles.
I worked with axios to connect with the API and I worked with useEffect.
The app uses many components and elements to handle the data.
