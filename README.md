# API & FetchData
Using API to work with data.

## usage
I'm using API from PIXABAY, so you can search anything image, you can use the tags of every image to do better searches.

## Installation
You don't need anymore than a browser, I will recomend you use Chome to have the best experience.

## Description
I used API fron PIXABAY to connect with its images, I used `axios` to fetch the data.
I worked with `dispatch({"FETCH_INIT"})` to sync with the API from Pixabay, `dispatch({"FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: result.data})` to load the fetch data and `dispatch({ type: "FETCH_FAILURE" });` to handle if the connexion were wrong.
I used Bootstrap to improve the skin
